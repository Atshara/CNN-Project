# CNN-Project
using Convolutional Neural Network to match labled veggies with prediction made by the model

this project uses TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn to train, test, and split the dataset so it can be used to train and test the model, to predict what vegetable is shown

Test Loss: 0.4311

Test Accuracy: 0.8550

the result may vary, with a prediction of 0.8550
